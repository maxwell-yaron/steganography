# Steganography

### Overview

Implementation of LSB [steganography][wiki]. Hide text, files and even other images into images.

### Example

#### Original image.
![alt text][canyon]

#### Modified image
![alt text][steg]

The two images appear identical, but the second image has the entire works of William Shakespeare embedded into the least significant bits.
